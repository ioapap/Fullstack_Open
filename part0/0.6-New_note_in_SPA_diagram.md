In this diagram, the user writes a note and clicks submit in the single-page version of the app. The JavaScript code prevents the traditional form submission, creates a new note, and updates the DOM. The browser then sends a POST request to the server with the new note in JSON format. The server adds the note to the notes array and responds with a 201 Created status. The browser updates the notes list without reloading the page.
