This diagram illustrates the steps involved in creating a new note on the page. The user writes a note and clicks submit, causing the browser to send a POST request to the server. The server adds the note to the notes array and then redirects the browser to the notes page. The browser then fetches the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JSON data before executing the JavaScript code and rendering the notes, including the newly created one.
